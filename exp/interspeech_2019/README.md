# Interspeech 2019

This directory contains source codes and examples of quaternion neural networks investigated for the Interspeech 2019 conference.

R2H: [Link to the paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333828348_Real_to_H-Space_Encoder_for_Speech_Recognition)

It is important to notice that the work presented in this paper is part of the [PyTorch-Kaldi](https://github.com/mravanelli/pytorch-kaldi), but was not released within it due to industrial reasons. To reproduce the exact results proposed in this work, it is therefore necessary to combine this simple example to [PyTorch-Kaldi](https://github.com/mravanelli/pytorch-kaldi).

Requirements
------------
A GPU with a running CUDA installation is preferable. Please follow the installation instructions of the root directory.

Usage
------------

```bash
python r2h.py        
```
